The obstacle avoidance rover is equipped with an 8051 microcontroller
for precise control and three strategically placed infrared sensors for
comprehensive obstacle detection. It has two 100 RPM motors powered by an
L298 motor driver, allowing for agile movement across a variety of terrains.
The rover's sturdy chassis, powered by a 12 Volt lead acetate battery,
supports four wheels, allowing for stability and maneuverability. Its
autonomous navigation capabilities allow it to detect obstacles in the front,
left, and back directions and adjust its path to avoid collisions. The compact
design and reliable performance make it ideal for surveillance, exploration,
and remote monitoring applications, providing a versatile solution for
addressing real-world challenges efficiently and precisely.
